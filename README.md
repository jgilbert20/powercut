Rsync, cp, bru with intelligent and persistent file checksumming 


The "swiss army knife" of file management
Rsync, cp, bru + time machine with intelligent and persistent file checksummin

This version intended mainly for my own use, and grew from 6 years 
of occasional weekend hacking -- it is a script, not an 
application. A major re-rewrite and cleanup is needed. Intended to 
be portable as a single file, so not as tidy as it should be.
